# Bash Scripts

This folder contains Bash scripts used across various experiments, prototypes, and utilities under the `lab/` workspace. These scripts are written to solve practical problems, assist in daily system tasks, and support DevOps workflows.

## Purpose

- Provide reusable, easy-to-understand automation scripts.
- Support daily tasks and system operations.
- Facilitate experimentation and testing in a controlled environment.
- Serve as a library of useful Bash utilities developed over time.

## üóÇÔ∏è Structure

Each script in this directory serves a distinct purpose:

```bash
lab/scripts/bash
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

Scripts can be executed directly or adapted into larger automation workflows.

## Usage

- Ensure the script has execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x script-name.sh
```
- Run the script from the terminal:
```bash
./script-name.sh
```
- Review and modify scripts to suit your environment and needs.
