# 🖥️ Bash Scripts

This folder contains Bash scripts used across various experiments, prototypes, and utilities under the `lab/` workspace. These scripts are written to solve practical problems, assist in daily system tasks, and support DevOps workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Provide reusable, easy-to-understand automation scripts.
- Support daily tasks and system operations.
- Facilitate experimentation and testing in a controlled environment.
- Serve as a library of useful Bash utilities developed over time.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

Each script in this directory serves a distinct purpose:

```bash
lab/scripts/bash
└── README.md
```

Scripts can be executed directly or adapted into larger automation workflows.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Ensure the script has execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x script-name.sh
```
2. Run the script from the terminal:
```bash
./script-name.sh
```
3. Scripts are designed to be adapted to your local environment or integrated into broader workflows.
