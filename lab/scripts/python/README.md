# 🐍 Python for DevOps

This section of the `ops-to-devops` project focuses on practical, real-world Python automation for DevOps and system administration tasks. It bridges the gap between operations and development using simple, maintainable Python code — no prior experience with object-oriented programming required.

## 🚀 Goals

- Build a **reusable Python automation toolkit** for DevOps engineers.
- Focus on **clarity, maintainability, and reproducibility**.
- Cover common use cases such as:
  - Managing servers and containers
  - Working with logs and APIs
  - Automating configuration tasks
  - Parsing files and executing shell commands
- Use **only the Python standard library** or lightweight dependencies when possible.
- Avoid overengineering (no frameworks unless needed).

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cb0n3y/ops-to-devops.git
cd ops-to-devops/python-for-devops
  
##  2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

##  3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

##  🧪 Testing
python -m unittest discover -s tests
🛠 Examples

    backup_config.py – Automatically back up configuration files from remote hosts.

    monitor_ports.py – Monitor local/remote TCP ports and alert if they go down.

    common_utils.py – Utility functions shared across scripts (e.g., logging, file handling).

🧰 Recommended Tools

Although not required, these tools are recommended to complement your workflow:

    pre-commit – Enforce code style and linting

    black – Code formatter

    mypy – Optional static typing

    direnv – Environment automation
