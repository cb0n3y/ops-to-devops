## Lab

This section includes:

- **Ansible**: Playbooks and roles for automation.
- **Bash**: Scripts for various administrative tasks.
- **Python**: Automation and utility scripts.
- **Docker**: Containerization setups.
- **Kubernetes**: Deployment configurations.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Deployment pipelines.

## IaaC

The IaaC/ directory represents a complete infrastructure setup, structured into different environments:

- **base/**: Shared configurations across all environments.
- **staging/**: Environment for testing and validation.
- **production/**: Live environment configurations.

Each environment includes:

- **applications/**: Deployed applications.
- **configs/**: Configuration files.
- **monitoring/**: Monitoring setups.
- **security/**: Security implementations.
